<h1 class="h1">Introduction of Backtracking</h1>
<p>The Backtracking is an algorithmic-method to solve a problem with an additional way. It uses a recursive approach to explain the problems. We can say that the backtracking is needed to find all possible combination to solve an optimization problem.</p>
<p><strong>Backtracking</strong> is a systematic way of trying out different sequences of decisions until we find one that "works."</p>

<li>Each non-leaf node in a tree is a parent of one or more other nodes (its children)</li>
<li>Each node in the tree, other than the root, has exactly one parent</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, however, we draw our trees downward, with the root at the top.</p>

<br>
<p>A tree is composed of nodes.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Backtracking can understand of as searching a tree for a particular "goal" leaf node.</strong></p>
<p>Backtracking is undoubtedly quite simple - we "explore" each node, as follows:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre><strong>To "explore" node N:</strong>
 1. If N is a goal node, return "success"
 2. If N is a leaf node, return "failure"
 3. For each child C of N,
     Explore C
     If C was successful, return "success"
 4. Return "failure"
</pre></div>
<p>Backtracking algorithm determines the solution by systematically searching the solution space for the given problem. Backtracking is a <strong>depth-first search</strong> with any bounding function. All solution using backtracking is needed to satisfy a complex set of constraints. The constraints may be explicit or implicit.</p>
<p><strong>Explicit Constraint</strong> is ruled, which restrict each vector element to be chosen from the given set.</p>
<p><strong>Implicit Constraint</strong> is ruled, which determine which each of the tuples in the solution space, actually satisfy the criterion function.</p>
